# Wikia-Scraper
Program made using Python and Kivy to scrape images from Wikia Fandom (fandom.com) pages

**Note:** It's normal for the program to go into "Not Responding" while scraping, leave it be (it is still getting the images).

With this in mind, heres the download. Just extract the folder and run the .exe (instructions are displayed in the program).
