# Wikia-Scraper
Program made using Python and Kivy to scrape images from Wikia Fandom (fandom.com) pages

Errors to make note of:
1. Program can't run two consecutive times in the same instance, please close and reopen after using once.
2. Inputting an invalid URL containing "fandom.com" will crash the program.
3. It's normal for the program to go into "Not Responding" while scraping, leave it be (it is still getting the images).

With this in mind, heres the download. Just extract the folder and run the .exe (instructions are displayed in the program).
